  abstract = {Traditional video understanding tasks include human action recognition and actor-object semantic segmentation. However, the joint task of providing semantic segmentation for different actor classes simultaneously with their action class remains a challenging but necessary task for many applications. In this work, we propose a new end-to-end architecture for tackling this joint task in videos. Our model effectively leverages multiple input modalities, contextual information, and joint multitask learning in the video to directly output semantic segmentations in a single unified framework. We train and benchmark our model on the large-scale Actor-Action Dataset (A2D) for joint actor-action semantic segmentation, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for both segmentation and detection. We also perform experiments verifying our joint approach improves performance for zero-shot understanding, indicating generalizability of our jointly learned feature space.},

In this work, we demonstrate that we can effectively train a VQA architecture with grounding supervision that can be automatically obtained from available region descriptions and object annotations.

Although there is a large body of research in areas such as movies or music, artwork recommendation has received comparatively little attention, despite the continuous growth of the artwork market. Most previous research has relied on ratings and metadata, and a few recent works have exploited visual features extracted with deep neural networks (DNN) to recommend digital art.

We implement and evaluate our method using transactional data from UGallery.com, an online artwork store. Our results show that artwork recommendations based on a hybrid combination of artist preference, curated attributes, deep neural visual features and manually-engineered visual features produce the best performance. Moreover, we discuss the trade-off between automatically obtained DNN features and manually-engineered visual features for the purpose of explainability, as well as the impact of user profile size on predictions.

Moreover, by using a group-sparse prior in the structured output learning

A global model, or gate function, complements the experts by learning a function that weighs their relevance in different parts of the input space. Local feature selection appears as an attractive alternative to improve the specialization of experts and gate function, particularly, in the case of high dimensional data. In general, subsets of dimensions, or subspaces, are usually more appropriate to classify instances located in different regions of the input space. Accordingly, this work contributes with a regularized variant of MoE that incorporates an embedded process for local feature selection using L1-regularization. Experiments using artificial and real-world datasets provide evidence that the proposed method improves the classical MoE technique, in terms of accuracy and sparseness of the solution.

both cases, a mid-level representation is build on top of low level image
descriptors while top levels classifiers use this mid-level

approaches, mid and top level representations are usually jointly trained, this
is not the usual case for BoVW schemes. A main reason is the complex data
association problem associated to the larger size of the visual dictionary

performance are the main reasons for its popularity. The central aspect of this
model, the visual dictionary, is used to build mid-level representations based on
low level image descriptors. Classifiers are then trained using these mid-level
representations to perform categorization. While most works based on BoVW
models have been focused on learning a suitable dictionary or on proposing a
suitable pooling strategy, little effort has been devoted to explore and improve
the coupling between the dictionary and the top-level classifiers, in order to gen-
erate more discriminative models. This problem can be highly complex due to
the large dictionary size usually needed by these methods. Also, most BoVW
based systems usually perform multiclass categorization using a one-vs-all strat-
egy, ignoring relevant correlations among classes. To tackle the previous issues,
we propose a novel approach that jointly learns dictionary words and a proper top-
level multiclass classifier. We use a max-margin learning framework to minimize
a regularized energy formulation, allowing us to propagate labeled information
to guide the commonly unsupervised dictionary learning process. As a result we
produce a dictionary that is more compact and discriminative. We test our method

our method as a generative probabilistic hierarchical model, where we use
object category classifiers to associate low-level visual features to objects,

gene function prediction},
  Journal = {Bioinformatics},
  Volume = {28},
  Number = {17},
  pages={2256-64},
  Year = {2012},
  abstract = {Motivation: Massive amounts of genome-wide gene expression data
have become available, motivating the development of computatio-
nal approaches that leverage this information to predict gene func-
tion. Among successful approaches, supervised machine learning
methods, such as Support Vector Machines, have shown superior
prediction accuracy. However, these methods lack the simple biologi-
cal intuition provided by coexpression networks, limiting their practical
usefulness.
Results: In this work we present Discriminative Local Subspaces
(DLS), a novel method that combines supervised machine learning
and coexpression techniques with the goal of systematically predict
genes involved in specific biological processes of interest. Unlike tra-
ditional coexpression networks, DLS uses the knowledge available in
Gene Ontology (GO) to generate informative training sets that guide
the discovery of expression signatures: expression patterns that are
discriminative for genes involved in the biological process of interest.
By linking genes coexpressed with these signatures, DLS is able
to construct a discriminative coexpression network that links both,
known and previously uncharacterized genes, for the selected bio-
logical process. This paper focuses on the algorithm behind DLS and
shows its predictive power using an Arabidopsis thaliana dataset and
a representative set of 101 GO-terms from the Biological Process
Ontology. Our results show that DLS has a superior average accuracy
than both, Support Vector Machines and Coexpression Networks.
Thus, DLS is able to provide the prediction accuracy of supervised
learning methods, while maintaining the intuitive understanding of
coexpression networks.
Availability and Implementation: A MATLAB R implementation
of DLS is available at http://virtualplant.bio.puc.cl/

    abstract = {Today, anomaly detection is a highly valuable application in the analysis of current huge datasets. Insurance
companies, banks and many manufacturing industries need systems to help humans to detect anomalies in their daily information.
In general, anomalies are a very small fraction of the data, therefore their detection is not an easy task. Usually real sources of
an anomaly are given by specific values expressed on selective dimensions of datasets, furthermore, many anomalies are not
really interesting for humans, due to the fact that interestingness of anomalies is categorized subjectively by the human user.
In this paper we propose a new semi-supervised algorithm that actively learns to detect relevant anomalies by interacting with
an expert user in order to obtain semantic information about user preferences. Our approach is based on 3 main steps. First, a
Bayes network identifies an initial set of candidate anomalies. Afterwards, a subspace clustering technique identifies relevant
subsets of dimensions. Finally, a probabilistic active learning scheme, based on properties of Dirichlet distribution, uses the
feedback from an expert user to efficiently search for relevant anomalies. Our results, using synthetic and real datasets, indicate
that, under noisy data and anomalies presenting regular patterns, our approach correctly identifies relevant anomalies.

X-ray image is filtered and enhanced to facilitate the detection
of fish bones. 3) Potential fish bones in the image are segmented
using band pass filtering, thresholding and morphological

are extracted from small detection windows that are defined
in those regions where potential fish bones were segmented.
5) A classifier is used to discriminate between ‘bones’ and
‘no-bones’ classes in the detection windows. 6) Finally, fish
bones in the X-ray image are isolated using morphological
operations applied on the corresponding segments classified as
‘bones’. In the experiments we used a high resolution flat panel
detector with the capacity to capture up to a 6 million pixel
digital X-ray image. In the training phase, we analyzed 20
representative salmon fillets, 7700 detection windows (10×10

analyzed 750 corn tortillas obtained from 15 different Mexican commercial stores which were either small, medium or large in

After implementing a feature selection algorithm, in which the most relevant features were selected for the classification of the

  Journal = {Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems},
  Volume = {58},
  Number = {3-4},
  Pages = {339-354},
  Year = {2010},
    abstract = {Localization is a key issue for a mobile robot, in particular in environments
where a globally accurate positioning system, such as GPS, is not available. In these
environments, accurate and efficient robot localization is not a trivial task, as an
increase in accuracy usually leads to an impoverishment in efficiency and viceversa.
Active perception appears as an appealing way to improve the localization process
by increasing the richness of the information acquired from the environment. In this
paper, we present an active perception strategy for a mobile robot provided with
a visual sensor mounted on a pan-tilt mechanism. The visual sensor has a limited
field of view, so the goal of the active perception strategy is to use the pan-tilt
unit to direct the sensor to informative parts of the environment. To achieve this
goal, we use a topological map of the environment and a Bayesian non-parametric
estimation of robot position based on a particle filter. We slightly modify the regular
implementation of this filter by including an additional step that selects the best
perceptual action using Monte Carlo estimations. We understand the best perceptual
action as the one that produces the greatest reduction in uncertainty about the
robot position. We also consider in our optimization function a cost term that
favors efficient perceptual actions. Previous works have proposed active perception
strategies for robot localization, but mainly in the context of range sensors, grid
representations of the environment, and parametric techniques, such as the extended
Kalman filter. Accordingly, the main contributions of this work are: i) Development
of a sound strategy for active selection of perceptual actions in the context of a visual
sensor and a topological map; ii) Real time operation using a modified version of the
particle filter and Monte Carlo based estimations; iii) Implementation and testing
of these ideas using simulations and a real case scenario. Our results indicate that,
in terms of accuracy of robot localization, the proposed approach decreases mean
average error and standard deviation with respect to a passive perception scheme.
Furthermore, in terms of efficiency, the active scheme is able to operate in real time
without adding a relevant overhead to the regular robot operation.

work we propose a new approach for indoor scene recognition
based on a generative probabilistic hierarchical model that uses
common objects as an intermediate semantic representation.
Under this model, we use object classifiers to associate low-
level visual features to objects, and at the same time, we use
contextual relations to associate objects to scenes. As a further
contribution, we improve the performance of current state-of-
the-art category-level object classifiers by including geometrical

the implementation of a focus of attention mechanism within a

cameras or cameras with highly constrained motions. Furthermore, many applications rely on features
derived from specific human poses, such as systems based on features derived from the human face
which is only visible when a person is facing the detecting camera. In this work, we present a new com-

based on four main steps: (i) preprocessing to achieve color constancy and stereo pair calibration, (ii) seg-

classification using a neural network. The main novelty of our approach lies in the feature extraction step,

in creating new image descriptors. A descriptor that has recently

To address this problem we have conducted an analysis on the
contribution of diverse features of an image to the descriptor and
therefore their contribution to the detection of varied targets, in
our case: faces and pedestrians. That is why we have defined a
methodology to determinate the performance of the covariance
matrix created from different characteristics. Now we are able to
determinate the best set of features for face and people detection,
for each problem. We have also achieved to establish that not
any kind of combination of features can be used because it might
not exist a correlation between them. Finally, when an analysis
is performed with the best set of features, for the face detection
problem we reach a performance of 99%, meanwhile for the
pedestrian detection problem we reach a performance of 85%.
With this we hope we have built a more solid base when choosing

that face images are well aligned and have a similar pose
– yet in many practical applications it is impossible to meet

  To this end, histograms of Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
  have proven to be highly discriminative descriptors for face
  recognition. Nonetheless, most LBP-based algorithms use a
  rigid descriptor matching strategy that is not robust against
  pose variation and misalignment.
  We propose two algorithms for face recognition that are de-

  incorporate an illumination normalization step that increases
  robustness against lighting variations. The proposed algorithms
  use descriptors based on histograms of LBP and perform
  descriptor matching with spatial pyramid matching (SPM) and

    that use an image-to-class relation to provide an improved

    We compare the accuracy of the proposed algorithms against
    Ahonen’s original LBP-based face recognition system and two

  booktitle = {Advances in Artificial Intelligence, Iberamia-08, LNCS 5290},
  pages = {163-172},
  year = {2008},
    abstract = {Today, the detection of anomalous records is a highly valu-
able application in the analysis of current huge datasets. In this paper
we propose a new algorithm that, with the help of a human expert, effi-
ciently explores a dataset with the goal of detecting relevant anomalous
records. Under this scheme the computer selectively asks the expert for
data labeling, looking for relevant semantic feedback in order to improve
its knowledge about what characterizes a relevant anomaly. Our ratio-
nale is that while computers can process huge amounts of low level data,
an expert has high level semantic knowledge to efficiently lead the search.
We build upon our previous work based on Bayesian networks that pro-
vides an initial set of potential anomalies. In this paper, we augment this
approach with an active learning scheme based on the clustering proper-
ties of Dirichlet distributions. We test the performance of our algorithm
using synthetic and real datasets. Our results indicate that, under noisy
data and anomalies presenting regular patterns, our approach signifi-
cantly reduces the rate of false positives, while decreasing the time to
reach the relevant anomalies.

  Title = {An autonomous educational mobile robot mediator},
  Journal = {Autonomous Robots},
  Volume = {25},
  Number = {4},
  Pages = {367-382},
  Year = {2008},
    abstract = {So far, most of the applications of robotic
technology to education have mainly focused on sup-
porting the teaching of subjects that are closely related
to the Robotics field, such as robot programming, robot
construction, or mechatronics. Moreover, most of the
applications have used the robot as an end or a passive
tool of the learning activity, where the robot has been
constructed or programmed. In this paper, we present a
novel application of robotic technologies to education,
where we use the real world situatedness of a robot to
teach non-robotic related subjects, such as math and
physics. Furthermore, we also provide the robot with
a suitable degree of autonomy to actively guide and
mediate in the development of the educational activ-
ity. We present our approach as an educational frame-
work based on a collaborative and constructivist learn-
ing environment, where the robot is able to act as an
interaction mediator capable of managing the interac-
tions occurring among the working students. We illus-
trate the use of this framework by a 4-step methodology
that is used to implement two educational activities.
These activities were tested at local schools with en-
couraging results. Accordingly, the main contributions
of this work are: i) A novel use of a mobile robot to
illustrate and teach relevant concepts and properties of
the real world; ii) A novel use of robots as mediators
that autonomously guide an educational activity using
a collaborative and constructivist learning approach;
iii) The implementation and testing of these ideas in
a real scenario, working with students at local schools.

Segmentations and Top-Down Feedback},
  Journal = {Robotics and Autonomous Systems},
  Volume = {56},
  Number = {6},
  Pages = {538-548},
  Year = {2008},
    abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the problem of unsupervised selection and posterior recognition of visual landmarks in images sequences
acquired by an indoor mobile robot. This is a highly valuable perceptual capability for a wide variety of robotic applications, in
particular autonomous navigation. Our method combines a bottom-up data driven approach with top-down feedback provided
by high level semantic representations. The bottom-up approach is based on three main mechanisms: visual attention, area
segmentation, and landmark characterization. As there is no segmentation method that works properly in every situation, we
integrate multiple segmentation algorithms in order to increase the robustness of the approach. In terms of the top-down feedback,
this is provided by two information sources: i) An estimation of the robot position that reduces the searching scope for potential
matches with previously selected landmarks, ii) A set of weights that, according to the results of previous recognitions, controls
the influence of each segmentation algorithm in the recognition of each landmark. We test our approach with encouraging results
in three datasets corresponding to real-world scenarios.

Networks},
  Journal = {Applied Artificial Intelligence},
  Volume = {22},
  Number = {4},
  Pages = {309-330},
  Year = {2008},
    abstract = {Today, there has been a massive proliferation of huge databases storing
valuable information. The opportunities of an effective use of these new
data sources are enormous, however, the huge size and dimensionality of
current large databases call for new ideas to scale up current statistical
and computational approaches. This paper presents an application of Ar-
tificial Intelligence technology to the problem of automatic detection of
candidate anomalous records in a large database. We build our approach
with three main goals in mind: 1)An effective detection of the records
that are potentially anomalous, 2)A suitable selection of the subset of at-
tributes that explains what makes a record anomalous, and 3)An efficient
implementation that allows us to scale the approach to large databases.
Our algorithm, called Bayesian Network Anomaly Detector (BNAD), uses the joint probability density function (pdf) provided by a Bayesian Net-
work (BN) to achieve these goals. By using appropriate data structures,
advanced caching techniques, the flexibility of Gaussian Mixture models,
and the efficiency of BNs to model joint pdfs, BNAD manages to effi-
ciently learn a suitable BN from a large dataset. We test BNAD using
synthetic and real databases, the latter from the fields of manufacturing
and astronomy, obtaining encouraging results.

are huge datasets available, offering an opportunity to extract

to learn from data by representing  knowledge as density functions.
In this paper, we choose  Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to
represent densities, as they possess great flexibility to adequate
 to a wide class of problems. The
classical estimation approach for GMMs corresponds to the iterative
algorithm of Expectation Maximization. This approach, however, does
not scale properly to meet the high demanding processing
requirements of large databases. In this paper we introduce an
EM-based algorithm, that solves the scalability problem. Our
approach is based on the concept of data condensation which, in
addition to substantially diminishing the computational load,
provides sound starting values that allow the algorithm to reach
convergence faster. We also focus on the model selection problem. We
test our algorithm using synthetic and real databases, and find
several advantages, when compared to other standard existing
procedures.},

    abstract = {The particle filter has emerged as a useful tool for
problems requiring dynamic state estimation. The
efficiency and accuracy of the filter depend mostly
on the number of particles used in the estimation
and on the propagation function used to re-allocate
these particles at each iteration. Both features are
specified beforehand and are kept fixed in the reg-
ular implementation of the filter. In practice this
may be highly inappropriate since it ignores errors
in the models and the varying dynamics of the pro-
cesses. This work presents a self adaptive version
of the particle filter that uses statistical methods to
adapt the number of particles and the propagation
function at each iteration. Furthermore, our method
presents similar computational load than the stan-
dard particle filter. We show the advantages of the
self adaptive filter by applying it to a synthetic ex-
ample and to the visual tracking of targets in a real
video sequence.
