  abstract	= {This paper addresses the human action recognition in video
		  by proposing a method based on three main processing steps.
		  First, we tackle problems related to intraclass variations
		  and differences in video lengths. We achieve this by
		  reducing an input video to a set of key-sequences that
		  represent atomic meaningful acts of each action class.
		  Second, we use sparse coding techniques to learn a
		  representation for each key-sequence. We then join these
		  representations still preserving information about temporal
		  relationships. We believe that this is a key step of our
		  approach because it provides not only a suitable shared rep
		  resentation to characterize atomic acts, but it also
		  encodes global tem poral consistency among these acts.
		  Accordingly, we call this represen tation inter-temporal
		  acts descriptor. Third, we use this representation and
		  sparse coding techniques to classify new videos. Finally,
		  we show that, our approach outperforms several
		  state-of-the-art methods when is tested using common

  abstract	= {This work presents an approach to category-based action
		  recognition in video using sparse coding techniques. The
		  proposed approach includes two main contributions: i) A new
		  method to handle intra-class variations by decomposing each
		  video into a reduced set of representative atomic action
		  acts or key-sequences, and ii) A new video descriptor,
		  ITRA: Inter-Temporal Relational Act Descriptor, that
		  exploits the power of comparative reasoning to capture
		  relative similarity relations among key-sequences. In terms
		  of the method to obtain key-sequences, we introduce a loss
		  function that, for each video, leads to the identification
		  of a sparse set of representative key-frames capturing
		  both, relevant particularities arising in the input video,
		  as well as relevant generalities arising in the complete
		  class collection. In terms of the method to obtain the ITRA
		  descriptor, we introduce a novel scheme to quantify
		  relative intra and inter-class similarities among local
		  temporal patterns arising in the videos. The resulting ITRA
		  descriptor demonstrates to be highly effective to
		  discriminate among action categories. As a result, the

		  performance on several popular benchmark datasets,

  year		= {2008},
  abstract	= {Today, there has been a massive proliferation of huge
		  databases storing valuable information. The opportunities
		  of an effective use of these new data sources are enormous,
		  however, the huge size and dimensionality of current large
		  databases call for new ideas to scale up current
		  statistical and computational approaches. This paper
		  presents an application of Ar- tificial Intelligence
		  technology to the problem of automatic detection of
		  candidate anomalous records in a large database. We build
		  our approach with three main goals in mind: 1)An effective
		  detection of the records that are potentially anomalous,
		  2)A suitable selection of the subset of at- tributes that
		  explains what makes a record anomalous, and 3)An efficient
		  implementation that allows us to scale the approach to
		  large databases. Our algorithm, called Bayesian Network
		  Anomaly Detector (BNAD), uses the joint probability density
		  function (pdf) provided by a Bayesian Net- work (BN) to
		  achieve these goals. By using appropriate data structures,
		  advanced caching techniques, the flexibility of Gaussian
		  Mixture models, and the efficiency of BNs to model joint
		  pdfs, BNAD manages to effi- ciently learn a suitable BN
		  from a large dataset. We test BNAD using synthetic and real
		  databases, the latter from the fields of manufacturing and
		  astronomy, obtaining encouraging results. },

  pages		= {339-354},
  year		= {2010},
  abstract	= {Localization is a key issue for a mobile robot, in
		  particular in environments where a globally accurate
		  positioning system, such as GPS, is not available. In these
		  environments, accurate and efficient robot localization is
		  not a trivial task, as an increase in accuracy usually
		  leads to an impoverishment in efficiency and viceversa.
		  Active perception appears as an appealing way to improve
		  the localization process by increasing the richness of the
		  information acquired from the environment. In this paper,
		  we present an active perception strategy for a mobile robot
		  provided with a visual sensor mounted on a pan-tilt
		  mechanism. The visual sensor has a limited field of view,
		  so the goal of the active perception strategy is to use the
		  pan-tilt unit to direct the sensor to informative parts of
		  the environment. To achieve this goal, we use a topological
		  map of the environment and a Bayesian non-parametric
		  estimation of robot position based on a particle filter. We
		  slightly modify the regular implementation of this filter
		  by including an additional step that selects the best
		  perceptual action using Monte Carlo estimations. We
		  understand the best perceptual action as the one that
		  produces the greatest reduction in uncertainty about the
		  robot position. We also consider in our optimization
		  function a cost term that favors efficient perceptual
		  actions. Previous works have proposed active perception
		  strategies for robot localization, but mainly in the
		  context of range sensors, grid representations of the
		  environment, and parametric techniques, such as the
		  extended Kalman filter. Accordingly, the main contributions
		  of this work are: i) Development of a sound strategy for
		  active selection of perceptual actions in the context of a
		  visual sensor and a topological map; ii) Real time
		  operation using a modified version of the particle filter
		  and Monte Carlo based estimations; iii) Implementation and
		  testing of these ideas using simulations and a real case
		  scenario. Our results indicate that, in terms of accuracy
		  of robot localization, the proposed approach decreases mean
		  average error and standard deviation with respect to a
		  passive perception scheme. Furthermore, in terms of
		  efficiency, the active scheme is able to operate in real
		  time without adding a relevant overhead to the regular
		  robot operation. },

		  conducted an analysis on the contribution of diverse

		  contribution to the detection of varied targets, in our
		  case: faces and pedestrians. That is why we have defined a
		  methodology to determinate the performance of the

		  Now we are able to determinate the best set of features for
		  face and people detection, for each problem. We have also
		  achieved to establish that not any kind of combination of
		  features can be used because it might not exist a
		  correlation between them. Finally, when an analysis is
		  performed with the best set of features, for the face
		  detection problem we reach a performance of 99%, meanwhile
		  for the pedestrian detection problem we reach a performance
		  of 85%. With this we hope we have built a more solid base

  abstract	= {Scene recognition is a highly valuable percep- tual
		  ability for an indoor mobile robot, however, current
		  approaches for scene recognition present a significant drop
		  in performance for the case of indoor scenes. We believe
		  that this can be explained by the high appearance
		  variability of indoor environments. This stresses the need
		  to include high- level semantic information in the
		  recognition process. In this work we propose a new approach
		  for indoor scene recognition based on a generative
		  probabilistic hierarchical model that uses common objects
		  as an intermediate semantic representation. Under this
		  model, we use object classifiers to associate low- level
		  visual features to objects, and at the same time, we use
		  contextual relations to associate objects to scenes. As a
		  further contribution, we improve the performance of current
		  state-of- the-art category-level object classifiers by
		  including geometrical information obtained from a 3D range
		  sensor that facilitates the implementation of a focus of
		  attention mechanism within a Monte Carlo sampling scheme.
		  We test our approach using real data, showing significant
		  advantages with respect to previous state-of-the-art
		  methods. },

  abstract	= {Mobile Robotics has achieved notably progress, however, to
		  increase the complexity of the tasks that mobile robots can
		  perform in natural environments, we need to provide them
		  with a greater semantic understanding of their surrounding.
		  In particular, identifying indoor scenes, such as an office
		  or a kitchen, is a highly valuable perceptual ability for
		  an indoor mobile robot, and in this paper we propose a new
		  technique to achieve this goal. As a distinguishing
		  feature, we use common objects, such as doors or
		  furnitures, as a key intermediate representation to
		  recognize indoor scenes. We frame our method as a
		  generative probabilistic hierarchical model, where we use
		  object category classifiers to associate low-level visual
		  features to objects, and contextual relations to associate
		  objects to scenes. The inherent seman- tic interpretation
		  of common objects allows us to use rich sources of online
		  data to populate the probabilistic terms of our model. In
		  contrast to alterna- tive computer vision based methods, we
		  boost performance by exploiting the embedded and dynamic
		  nature of a mobile robot. In particular, we increase
		  detection accuracy and efficiency by using a 3D range
		  sensor that allows us to implement a focus of attention
		  mechanism based on geometric and struc- tural information.
		  Furthermore, we use concepts from information theory to
		  propose an adaptive scheme that limits computational load
		  by selectively guiding the search for informative objects.
		  The operation of this scheme is facilitated by the dynamic
		  nature of a mobile robot that is constantly changing its
		  field of view. We test our approach using real data
		  captured by a mo- bile robot navigating in office and home
		  environments. Our results indicate that the proposed
		  approach outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques },

		  methods are the most popular approaches for visual

		  build on top of low level image descriptors while top
		  levels classifiers use this mid-level representation to
		  achieve visual recognition. While in current part-based
		  approaches, mid and top level representations are usually
		  jointly trained, this is not the usual case for BoVW

		  In this work we propose a novel hierarchical approach for

		  for visual recognition. Used successfully in many different

		  for its popularity. The central aspect of this model, the
		  visual dictionary, is used to build mid-level
		  representations based on low level image descriptors.
		  Classifiers are then trained using these mid-level
		  representations to perform categorization. While most works
		  based on BoVW models have been focused on learning a
		  suitable dictionary or on proposing a suitable pooling
		  strategy, little effort has been devoted to explore and
		  improve the coupling between the dictionary and the

		  constrained face images has become an active area of
		  research. To this end, histograms of Local Binary Patterns
		  (LBP) have proven to be highly discriminative descriptors
		  for face recognition. Nonetheless, most LBP-based
		  algorithms use a rigid descriptor matching strategy that is
		  not robust against pose variation and misalignment. We

  abstract	= {X-ray testing is playing an increasingly important role in
		  food quality assurance. In the production of fish fillets,
		  however, fish bone detection is performed by human
		  operators using their sense of touch and vision which can
		  lead to misclassification. In countries where fish is often
		  consumed, fish bones are some of the most frequently
		  ingested foreign bodies encountered in foods. Effective
		  detection of fish bones in the quality control process
		  would help avoid this problem. For this reason, we
		  developed an X-ray machine vision approach to au-
		  tomatically detect fish bones in fish fillets. This paper
		  describes our approach and the corresponding validation
		  experiments with salmon fillets. The approach consists of
		  six steps: 1) A digital X-ray image is taken of the fish
		  fillet being tested. 2) The X-ray image is filtered and
		  enhanced to facilitate the detection of fish bones. 3)
		  Potential fish bones in the image are segmented using band
		  pass filtering, thresholding and morphological techniques.
		  4) Intensity features of the enhanced X-ray image are
		  extracted from small detection windows that are defined in
		  those regions where potential fish bones were segmented. 5)
		  A classifier is used to discriminate between ‘bones’
		  and ‘no-bones’ classes in the detection windows. 6)
		  Finally, fish bones in the X-ray image are isolated using
		  morphological operations applied on the corresponding
		  segments classified as ‘bones’. In the experiments we
		  used a high resolution flat panel detector with the
		  capacity to capture up to a 6 million pixel digital X-ray
		  image. In the training phase, we analyzed 20 representative
		  salmon fillets, 7700 detection windows (10×10 pixels) and
		  279 intensity features. Cross validation yielded a
		  detection performance of 95% using a support vector machine
		  classifier with only 24 selected features. We believe that
		  the proposed approach opens new possibilities in the field
		  of automated visual inspection of salmon and other similar

		  Currently, most successful approaches to human detection
		  are based on background substraction techniques that apply
		  only to the case of static cameras or cameras with highly
		  constrained motions. Furthermore, many applications rely on
		  features derived from specific human poses, such as systems
		  based on features derived from the human face which is only

		  this work, we present a new com- puter vision algorithm
		  designed to operate with moving cameras and to detect
		  humans in different poses under partial or complete view of
		  the human body. We follow a standard pattern recognition
		  approach based on four main steps: (i) preprocessing to
		  achieve color constancy and stereo pair calibration, (ii)
		  seg- mentation using depth continuity information, (iii)
		  feature extraction based on visual saliency, and (iv)
		  classification using a neural network. The main novelty of
		  our approach lies in the feature extraction step, where we

		  mechanism. In contrast to previous works, we do not use a
		  pyramidal decomposition to run the saliency algorithm, but
		  we implement this at the original image resolution using
		  the so-called integral image. Our results indicate that our

		  performance, however, previous work considers only fixed
		  contextual relations that do not depend of the type of
		  scene under inspection. In this work, we present a method
		  that learns adaptive conditional relation- ships that
		  depend on the type of scene being analyzed. In particular,
		  we propose a model based on a conditional mixture of trees
		  that is able to capture contextual relationships among

		  purity with respect to class labels. In particular, we
		  present Labeled K-Means (LK-Means), an algorithm for
		  supervised clustering based on a variant of K-Means that
		  incorporates information about class labels. LK-Means
		  replaces the classical cost function of K-Means by a convex
		  combination of the joint cost associated to: (i) A

		  generative score based on a traditional metric for

		  LK-Means using standard real datasets and an application
		  for object recognition. Moreover, we also compare its
		  performance against classical K-Means and a popular
		  K-Medoids-based supervised clustering method. Our
		  experiments show that, in most cases, LK-Means outperforms

		  Gaussian Processes are used to build for each available

		  data have become available, motivating the development of
		  computatio- nal approaches that leverage this information
		  to predict gene func- tion. Among successful approaches,
		  supervised machine learning methods, such as Support Vector
		  Machines, have shown superior prediction accuracy. However,
		  these methods lack the simple biologi- cal intuition
		  provided by coexpression networks, limiting their practical
		  usefulness. Results: In this work we present Discriminative
		  Local Subspaces (DLS), a novel method that combines
		  supervised machine learning and coexpression techniques
		  with the goal of systematically predict genes involved in
		  specific biological processes of interest. Unlike tra-
		  ditional coexpression networks, DLS uses the knowledge
		  available in Gene Ontology (GO) to generate informative
		  training sets that guide the discovery of expression
		  signatures: expression patterns that are discriminative for
		  genes involved in the biological process of interest. By
		  linking genes coexpressed with these signatures, DLS is
		  able to construct a discriminative coexpression network
		  that links both, known and previously uncharacterized
		  genes, for the selected bio- logical process. This paper
		  focuses on the algorithm behind DLS and shows its
		  predictive power using an Arabidopsis thaliana dataset and
		  a representative set of 101 GO-terms from the Biological
		  Process Ontology. Our results show that DLS has a superior
		  average accuracy than both, Support Vector Machines and
		  Coexpression Networks. Thus, DLS is able to provide the
		  prediction accuracy of supervised learning methods, while
		  maintaining the intuitive understanding of coexpression
		  networks. Availability and Implementation: A MATLAB R

		  Expectation Maximization. This approach, however, does not
		  scale properly to meet the high demanding processing
		  requirements of large databases. In this paper we introduce
		  an EM-based algorithm, that solves the scalability problem.
		  Our approach is based on the concept of data condensation
		  which, in addition to substantially diminishing the
		  computational load, provides sound starting values that
		  allow the algorithm to reach convergence faster. We also
		  focus on the model selection problem. We test our algorithm
		  using synthetic and real databases, and find several
		  advantages, when compared to other standard existing
		  procedures.},
